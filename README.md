# gt_challenge

Challenge took roughly 11-13 hours to complete. Would have been much shorter if I found the starter code generator available on MapBox's website. 

#Bonus Features
- Implementation of the repository pattern. Will pull from database if no internet connection. 
- Use of Room database 
- Extensive use of rxjava. Most notably seen within the repository. 
- Use of android specific Dagger. 
- Custom user icon and markers specifically pulled from the api. 
- Implementation of a listener within the recyclerview. 
- Use of inheritance within the viewmodel and implementation of disposable that respects the lifecycle
- An absolutely fabulous icon that you'll surely enjoy!

- Editing the points 
- Icons change depending on keywords in description
- Sharing the location to a friend
